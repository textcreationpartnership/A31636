            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> may make Gentlemen ſo ſenſible of the Benefit of Trade, as to Imploy their Heads and Time to conſult the beſt Laws and Methods to encourage it.</p>
            <p>This Method not only Secures the Perſons Engaging their Eſtates in this Deſign, from being looſers, but makes them great gainers.</p>
            <p>It ſecures the Nation, as well as every particular Perſon, from any prejudice by the Tickets, becauſe the Money lent as aforeſaid, muſt be paid off, and Diſcharged by the Rent of the Land Mortgaged, which cannot be denyed, but to be equal to the beſt Mortgages now in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Method will make us Maſters of the beſt of Trades, and much more National than was ever yet pretended to: For this Company will be obliged to Build all their Ships and Buſſes, and to make all their Nets, and other Implements of Fiſhery in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tho' they will at firſt, untill by Cuſtome and Uſe we grow expert in thoſe Arts and Trades, coſt us above 30 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> more than we now have them Imported to us from Abroad.</p>
            <p>The making all the Neceſſaries for Fiſhing in <hi>England,</hi> will maintain many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of People now Chargeable to the Pariſhes: And by increaſing Manufactures, that maintain and imploy them (if convenient Laws could be obtained for Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Forraigners, to come and Inhabit here) we ſhould have a great Increaſe of People, which will cauſe a great increaſe of Trade, which is the only way to raiſe the Value of Land, and to ſecure the ſame by Sea and Land againſt any Enemy.</p>
            <p>This Method, or Bank Credit, is no new thing to other Nations: being Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in the beſt Trading places in the World, tho' under worſe Circumſtances, as <hi>Holland, Hamburgh, Venice,</hi> and other places in <hi>Italy.</hi> Their Banks have no certain Fund, and are by moſt People Believed not worth one third of what they owe, and yet their Credit is more Valuable than Gold or Silver Money, for 100 <hi>l.</hi> Bank Credit is frequently transferred for 2, 3, or 4. <hi>per Cent.</hi> advance, and never ſo low as for a 100 <hi>l.</hi> in money, Which is well known to Traders in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then their Banks, with an uncertain Fund, appears by their long continuance, to be ſo Beneficial and Valuable to Trading Nations, why ſhould not this? having a certain Fund, ſufficient in the perfixt time to Pay off the whole Debt, which yearly Leſſens, and the Fund accordingly Increaſeth in Value: And carrying with it all the ſame benefits and conveniencies to our Nation: as they reap by theirs: beſides the mighty National Advantage of this deſired Fiſhing Trade.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all is no more but to obtain a Charter to Incorporate ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as are willing to engage their Eſtates to recover the Fiſhing-Trade, Eſteemed ſo great and deſireable a Jewel to the Nation, and now poſſeſt by Forraigners.</p>
            <p>And, tho' the Bills of Exchange of this Company have equal priviledge with other Perſons, to run upon their bare Reputation, yet none of their Bills are propoſed to paſs, without a greater value of Land be Tackt to them by the Parliament, according to a Method prepared,</p>
            <p>And laſtly, That their Bills ſo ſettled, being more uſeful and valuable than Money of the beſt Gold or Silver, may, for the ſame reaſons as Gold and Silver money is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, be made Current in all Publick and Private Payments: which is no more than what time and Cuſtome would introduce of Courſe, as is Demonſtrable by ſuch Bankers having the greateſt Credit, as are but reputed to have the beſt Fund.</p>
            <p>And becauſe nothing under Heaven can be ſo perfect, as not to admit of Objections, it is humbly hoped that it will be conſidered, whether the great Advantages certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following this Undertaking, do not far out-ballance all the ſuppoſed Objections, which can poſſibly be brought againſt it, and may be eaſily cleared, when the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ſhall be Methodically made.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to add ſomething here in defence of joynt Stocks, becauſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Papers have of late been diſperſed, which condemn them in General: It is confeſt, joynt Stocks which ingroſs any Trade, ought not to be granted without good Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: But ſuch joynt Stocks, as neither Interrupts nor Prohibits any other to Trade the ſame way, is no more to be diſcouraged, than a Rich Merchant, becauſe there are Poorer: beſides There are theſe two Advantages in a joynt Stock, firſt, many things can be put in Practice, which ſmaller Stocks cannot reach to. Secondly, Things of great hazard will be Attempted, when none can be ruined by their Failures.</p>
